A Chemistry student 🧪 with an enthusiasm for Software Engineering 💻. I love solving problems - whether a tricky chemical equation or a stubborn piece of code. Who knew debugging could be as satisfying as balancing equations?

I'm fascinated by the blend of science and technology, always curious, experimenting, and learning. I enjoy turning challenges into creative solutions, and yes...sometimes my experiments explode but that's just part of the fun!
